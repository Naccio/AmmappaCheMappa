# Ammappa che mappa

This is a tool I started building for fun when I was DMing a D&D
campaign and couldn't find a suitable tool for drawing world maps.

The main objectives I have are:
 - Have fun
 - Learn some TypeScript
 - Use zero dependencies
 - Use zero backend
 - Use modern HTML features

A live version of the latest release can be seen at
[this link](https://naccio.github.io/AmmappaCheMappa/).

> ***Keep in mind that this tool is in early [alpha](CHANGELOG.md),
> so expect stuff to break a lot.***
